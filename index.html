            <h2>Strategy Development Philosophy & Approach</h2>
            <p>
                My strategy development process begins with curiosity.<br>
             When I encounter a promising idea—whether from academic research, trading forums, podcasts, books, or educational
             content—my immediate reaction is: "That's an interesting coding challenge!"<br>
             This hands-on approach serves a purpose beyond implementation; coding forces me to understand the underlying market
             inefficiency being exploited at a granular level.<br><br>
             This deeper understanding naturally reveals potential pitfalls, particularly the risk of overfitting.
             When optimization is required, I leverage RealTest to analyze parameter sensitivity across multiple dimensions:
             Trade Count, Net Profit, Rate of Return, Maximum Drawdown, MAR Ratio, and Expectancy. My goal is to identify the robust middle ground—the flattest,
             most stable parameter ranges that suggest genuine edge rather than curve-fitted results.<br><br>
             This approach combines systematic rigor with informed discretion. Every decision is data-driven,
             grounded in what the backtest reveals rather than speculation. Just as physicians study diagnostics before operating,
             I believe traders must thoroughly understand their systems before deploying capital. 
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Risk Management Section -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Risk Management & Position Sizing</h2>
            <p>
                My risk management framework begins with a fundamental question: "What instrument am I trading?" Corporate-specific risk is substantial,
             which is why I avoid individual stock positions entirely and focus exclusively on strategies that trade diversified instruments.<br><br>
             Position sizing follows a consistent formula across all systems: (Portfolio Closed Trade Equity × Risk Percentage) / ATR(5).
             I maintain strict limits, capping total position size at 5% of overall portfolio value. I also monitor VIX levels when initiating new positions,
             adjusting exposure during elevated volatility regimes.<br><br>
             Stop-loss approaches vary by system—some utilize market-based stops while others employ different exit mechanisms.
             All orders are generated after market close each day, with resting orders placed directly with my broker.
             This systematic process ensures consistency and removes emotional decision-making from execution.
            </p>

             <!-- Tools and Data Section -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Tools and Data</h2>
            <p>
                My trading evolution reflects a practical progression toward efficiency. I began in 2021 with paper-based tracking, quickly
             transitioning to Excel/Google Sheets with Yahoo Finance data in 2022. The turning point came in fall 2023 when Marsten Parker's
             appearance on Mike Covel's podcast introduced me to RealTest.<br><br>
             Since subscribing to RealTest and Norgate Data in October 2023, my development workflow has transformed dramatically.
             The combination delivers exceptional speed—I can now design, test, and validate a complete trading system in RealTest faster than
             I could previously load and clean Yahoo data in Excel. While I've built systems in Python, RealTest's efficiency and purpose-built
             design have become indispensable for both strategy development and daily order generation.

            <h2>Professional Background & Transferable Skills</h2>
            <p>
               While I don't hold a PhD in mathematics, I bring something equally valuable to algorithmic strategy development:
             thousands of hours solving complex problems where precision is non-negotiable. My background in auto collision repair has
             instilled a systematic, detail-oriented approach that translates directly to quantitative trading.<br><br>
            More importantly, this field has made me an expert communicator of technical complexity—a skill where many quants struggle.
             Daily, I translate intricate technical analysis into clear, compelling explanations for non-technical audiences: insurance
             adjusters evaluating repair costs, vehicle owners making coverage decisions, and shop managers coordinating resources.
             I don't just understand the technical details; I can explain why they matter in terms stakeholders actually care about.<br><br>
            This communication strength directly addresses a critical gap in quantitative trading. A brilliant strategy is worthless if you can't
             articulate its logic to investors, explain its risk profile to partners, or justify its approach to decision-makers.
             I excel at distilling complex systematic approaches into narratives that resonate—explaining not just what a strategy does,
             but why it works, what market conditions favor it, and how it fits within a broader portfolio context.<br><br>
            The technical rigor from collision repair reinforces this advantage. In that field, the margin for error is zero—a misalignment
             of millimeters compounds into structural failure. This environment taught me to think in systems, identify dependencies,
             and validate assumptions before execution. I learned that shortcuts create compounding problems, a principle I apply
             directly to systematic trading through thorough testing, conservative parameter selection, and disciplined risk management.<br><br>
            The combination is powerful: technical precision paired with the ability to make complex ideas accessible.
             In an industry where quants often struggle to explain their work beyond technical audiences, I bridge that gap naturally.
