            <h2>Strategy Development Philosophy & Approach</h2>
            <p>
                When an idea for a strategy comes to me, whether from reading a paper,
                seeing it in forum, hearing it on a podcast, reading it in a book, 
                seeing it on YouTube, my first though is, "That sounds like an interesting coding challenge!"<br>
                While I'm coding, I get a deeper understanding of what market weakness is being exploited.
                This then leads me to be aware of the ways in-which it could easily become over-fit. Which leads me to 
                parameter selection.<br>
                If optimization is necessary, I will use RealTest to show me the range of parameters in Trade Count, 
                Net Profit, ROR, MaxDD, MAR, Expectancy. Then I will attempt to use 
                the robust middle of the flattest range. 
            </p>
            <p>
               This programmed discretion is very much a form of art but the
               decision's are made from what was seen in the backtest, not from guessing.<br>
               <b><i>Doctors don't perform surgery before studying all the data.</i></b>
            </p>

        <!-- Risk Management Section -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Risk Management & Position Sizing</h2>
            <p>
                For me, risk management starts with the question, "What instrument is being traded?"<br>
                Cooperate risk is no joke. I don't hold any single stocks and I don't use strategies that trade single stocks.<br>
                I base my positions using the portfolio's closed-trade-equity x risk amount / ATR(5)
                and total position size does not exceed 5% of the overall portfolio.<br>
                VIX spikes are also considered when opening new positions.<br>
                Position sizes are calculated the same for every system.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some systems have stops in the market, while others do not.<br> 
                Orders are generated daily, after the market close, and resting orders are placed with the broker.
            </p>

             <!-- Tools and Data Section -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Tools and Data</h2>
            <p>
                I started trading in 2021 using a piece of paper with a list of stocks.<br>
                Quickly moved to Excel/Google Sheets and free data from yahoo in 2022.<br>
                In fall 2023, Marsten Parker appeared on Mike Covel's podcast. I checked out RealTest
                and signed up in October along with Norgate Data.<br>
                The great thing about RealTest and Norgate is <i>speed!</i><br>
                I can formulate and test a system in RealTest before I could even load and clean Yahoo data in Excel.<br>
                I've built a few systems in Python but, honestly, RealTest has me spoiled for system development and daily order generation.
